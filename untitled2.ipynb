            " , formerly (2003–17) Tesla Motors,  American manufacturer of electric automobiles, solar panels, and batteries for cars and home power storage.\n",
            "  It was founded in 2003 by American entrepreneurs Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning and was named after Serbian American inventor Nikola Tesla.\n",
            " Tesla Motors was formed to develop an electric sports car.\n",
            "  Eberhard was Tesla’s chief executive officer (CEO) and Tarpenning its chief financial officer (CFO).\n",
            "  Funding for the company was obtained from a variety of sources, most notably PayPal cofounder Elon Musk, who contributed more than $30 million to the new venture and served as chairman of the company, beginning in 2004.\n",
            " In 2008 Tesla Motors released its first car, the completely electric Roadster.\n",
            "  In company tests, it achieved 245 miles (394 km) on a single charge, a range unprecedented for a production electric car.\n",
            "  Additional tests showed that its performance was comparable to that of many gasoline-powered sports cars: the Roadster could accelerate from 0 to 60 miles (96 km) per hour in less than four seconds and could reach a top speed of 125 miles (200 km) per hour.\n",
            "  The lightweight car body was made of carbon fibre.\n",
            "  The Roadster produced no tailpipe emissions, as it did not use an internal-combustion engine.\n",
            "  Tesla Motors found that the car attained efficiency ratings that were equivalent to a gasoline mileage of 135 miles per gallon (57 km per litre).\n",
            "  The vehicle’s electric motor was powered by lithium-ion cells—often used in laptop-computer batteries—that could be recharged from a standard electrical outlet.\n",
            "  Despite a federal tax credit of $7,500 for purchasing an electric vehicle, the Roadster’s cost of $109,000 made it a luxury item.\n",
            " In late 2007 Eberhard resigned as CEO and president of technology and joined the advisory board of the company.\n",
            "  It was announced in 2008 that he had left the company, though he remained a shareholder.\n",
            "  Tarpenning, who was vice president of electrical engineering, supervising the development of electronic and software systems for the Roadster, also left the company in 2008.\n",
            "  Musk took over as CEO.\n",
            "  In 2010 Tesla’s initial public offering raised some $226 million.\n",
